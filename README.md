## About this Project
This could be an interactive background for a login portal or anything else you can think of.

I wanted to make an interactive background and this is what I came up with. You can move the mouse around to change color of items. I'll be expanding on this over time. 

I wrote my first quadtree on this project. It turned out pretty well and greatly increased performance!

### Setting up the project
* Open your terminal of choice and navigate to the root of the project folder.
* Run `npm install` to download all of the required packages. If you don't have `npm` you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
* After all packages are downloaded, you should be able to run `ng serve` in your terminal.  
This will launch a development server and watch for file changes. 
* Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you save any changes made to source while the server is running.
